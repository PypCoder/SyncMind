## 📌 Project Description

**SyncMind** is a personal workflow management desktop application built in **Python (Tkinter)**.  
It acts as your intelligent **solo productivity assistant**, combining features like smart task tracking, modular tools (called **Rooms**), and AI-assisted helpers — all wrapped in a fast, local-first interface.

Whether you're planning, thinking, or working — SyncMind keeps your flow, thoughts, and tasks connected and organized.

## 🧠 Philosophy: Designed for Deep Focus and Flow

SyncMind isn’t just a productivity tool — it’s a mindset system.  
Built to support creators, coders, thinkers, and dreamers who work alone but think big.

- 🔒 **Offline-First**  
  Everything can be runed locally. No cloud dependencies. Your data stays *yours* — private, portable, and persistent.

- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**  
  Add new tools (“Rooms”) without breaking the core. Customize SyncMind to match *your* workflow.

- 🛠️ **Hackable by Design**  
  Want to add a custom Python script? A mini AI model? SyncMind encourages experimentation, not limitation.

- 👤 **Solo-First Workflow**  
  Unlike team-oriented tools, SyncMind is made for **self-led productivity** — for managing *your* ideas, *your* tasks, *your* brain.

- 🧠 **Flow-Driven Navigation**  
  Switch between **Think**, **Plan**, and **Do** modes. Let the system guide you or build your own structure.

## 🚀 Setup & Run Instructions

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `pip` installed

### 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SyncMind.git
cd SyncMind
pip install -r requirements.txt

# First, run the backend
cd backend
python app.py

# Then, open a second terminal and run the GUI
cd gui
python main.py
```
>✅ For offline-only usage, the backend is optional (depending on Room)

## 🧩 How to Add a New Room (Your Own Tool)

Creating a new Room is easy — just follow this template:

---

### 1. Create a Room File

Inside `gui/pages/rooms`, create a new file like `my_room.py`:

```python
import tkinter as tk

class MyRoom(tk.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, controller):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.controller = controller
        tk.Label(self, text="🧪 My Custom Room").pack(pady=20)
```
> This code is a must — further functionality is added below it

### 2. Add Button to Reception
In ReceptionPage, add detailes properly to navigate to it:

```python
rooms = [
    {"name": "My Room", "page": "MyRoom"},
    ...
]
```
> Make sure *page* is the same as your *room's class name* — i.e. **Class MyRoom(tk.Frame)**

<details>
  <summary>📦 Internal Room Registry (Click to Expand)</summary>

  <br/>

  ```python
  rooms = [
      {"name": "QuoteRoom", "page": "QuoteRoom"},
      {"name": "CourtroomAI", "page": "CourtroomAI"},
      {"name": "EDA Explorer", "page": "EDAExplorer"},
      {"name": "House Price Predictor", "page": "HousePricePredictor"},
      {"name": "Focus Timer", "page": "FocusTimer"},
      {"name": "Decision Dice", "page": "DecisionDiceRoom"},
      {"name": "Would You Rather", "page": "WouldYouRatherRoom"}
  ]
```
<blockquote> 🛠️ Each room is modularly imported, registered, and routed using the <code>controller.show_frame()</code> system. </blockquote> </details>
